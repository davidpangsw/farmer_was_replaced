The language is a subset of python, which means some syntax doesn't work. Here is the list


```py
# doesn't work, use a normal for loop to append, or use the method written in utils
[East] * (width - 1)

# doesn't work, use normal if/else
min_width = apple_x + 2 if (apple_x + 2) % 2 == 0 else apple_x + 3

# Don't work. Don't use any bitwise operator
x = x & 1

```
