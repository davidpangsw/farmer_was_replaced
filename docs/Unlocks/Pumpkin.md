Pumpkins

Pumpkins grow on tilled soil just like carrots. They require pumpkin seeds to be planted which cost one carrot each.

If every pumpkin in a square has fully grown they grow together into a giant pumpkin. The yield of a giant pumpkin is the side length of the pumpkin cubed.

A 2x2 pumpkin yields 2*2*2 = 8 pumpkins instead of 4
A 3x3 pumpkin yields 3*3*3 = 27 pumpkins instead of 9
A 4x4 pumpkin yields 4*4*4 = 64 pumpkins instead of 16
...

It's a good idea to make the pumpkins as big as possible before harvesting them. The problem is that about 1 in 5 pumpkins dies before growing up. This means that even if you plant a pumpkin on every tile in a square one of the pumpkins may die preventing the mega pumpkin from growing. A pumpkin that dies simply disappears so you can plant a new one there.
Pumpkin growth

All pumpkins have a fixed probability of dying right as they finish growing; nothing alters this chance and they will never die sooner.

See Plant growth for more detailed info on pumpkin growth.

The above description is not accurate. If a pumpkin is dead, it turns to a Entities.Dead_Pumpkin, that you can plant on it directly.
