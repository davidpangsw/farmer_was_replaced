Tree

Trees are a better way of getting wood than bushes. They yield 5 wood each. Just like bushes they can be planted on grass or soil.

Trees like to have some space and planting them right next to each other will slow down their growth. The grow time will double for every tree that is on one of the tiles directly to the North, East, West or South of it. So if you plant trees on every tile they will take 2*2*2*2 = 16 times longer to grow.
